# Hey !! ðŸ‘‹
I'am om patil,\
I'm a software developer who loves making 3D animations using Blender. I'm really good at C and C++ programming and I'm learning Dart, Java, Python, and Rust to get even better.\
\
I think coding is like being an artistâ€”creating cool stuff and making it look awesome. My big goal is to get really good at different programming languages and use them to create amazing software and 3D animations.
